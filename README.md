# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Global Baseline Level of Technical Competency and Collaboration is at an all-time high, 
but has reached a plateau and has indeed begun to decline. 
Technology continues improving at an exponential rate, 
while the majority of mankind evolves at such a slow rate it is rendered insignificant in comparison. 
Global technological ambitions have almost always been determined by the wealthy and powerful rulers of nations, 
and thereby angled toward the creation of surveillance, 
military power, 
political manipulation, 
and other technological forms of domination. 
With the advent of the internet and the adoption of social collaboration applications like GitHub, 
there have never been more people in the world with the power to shift the trend away from creating technologies designed to dominate 
and toward creating technologies designed to uplift. 
In a world where civil, 
social, 
and economic justice are in the forefront of the minds of many individuals, 
where public trust in the political system, 
the education system, 
and the economic 'powers that be' are at an all-time low, 
global political will for grassroots social collaboration has never been higher. 
Social media consumes the attention of most of my generation, 
to the point of addiction--
we constantly crave the validation of our peers to fill the void where our self-esteem should be. 
Knowing full well that self-esteem is earned through confidence in one's ability to gain what one desires 
without harming or deceiving other people, 
a great disdain for the compulsory education system has begun to bubble beneath the surface of society. 
For what is the purpose of the education system if not to make its students more competent and capable of changing the world they live in? 
And what right do they have to charge such cripplingly high tuitions if they are objectively not serving their students' highest good; 
not even putting their students in a position to be able to pay off their debts? 
And again, 
through social media, 
we live in a world where even though we are more connected than ever, 
so many of us feel lonely and isolated, 
and develop a nihilistic or absurdist view of reality. 
We cast all our responsibility for changing the world on an absentee Father called God, 
who seems to have left the world in the hands of his incompetent children. 
The world yearns for peace, 
while its leaders spend trillions on wars. 
The world yearns for greater skill and competency, 
while the education system's leaders dumb down its curriculum to serve their corporate masters. 
The world yearns for connection and self-esteem, 
while the creators of social media do nothing to address the cycle of validation addiction they gave given birth to. 
The world is ready for a change.

The world is ready for a universal education system, personalized to its students and designed by its students, that is continuously optimizing its method of instruction to increase comprehension of knowledge, encourage its practical application, and inspire a lifelong commitment to learning and creativity... All while standardizing skills and competencies, so that neither students nor employers ever have to worry that they will be too incompetent to fulfill their job descriptions.

The world is ready for an application that guides its users through the process of rediscovering and defining their purpose, their passion, and the projects they wish to bring into reality, the process of determining which profession, career path, or skills are worthy of their lifelong devotion, the process of identifying which skills should be delegated and left for others to learn, and the process of recruiting those people for a worthy cause.

The world is ready for a social collaboration tool that can transcend the political machine and hand the power back to the people by walking its users through the process of planning, organizing, and executing MegaProjects.

The world is ready for the MindFlower. 
The world is ready for the Adventure Guide.
The world is ready for the Quest Log.

When we were young, they told us we could be anything and do anything we put our minds to. We're the generation that is going to make that fact obvious to the next generation.

# FEATURES

# MindFlower
MindFlower is a Global University, 
Online + In-Person 
that aims to standardize education worldwide 
by certifying the 'best practices' for each industry. 
Certification programs are created and taught by field-active workers so all the information is up-to-date and industry standard, 
and each program is designed to develop specific skills that can be practically applied, 
so that neither applicants nor employers have to worry that applicants are coming into the workforce underinformed or incompetent. 
The skills taught through the programs are logged and organized into a Skill Tree to be utilized by the following apps.

# Adventure Guide
Using the Skill Tree from MindFlower, 
this application guides users through the process of 'individuation', 
where the user defines their highest values, 
deepest motivations, 
and biggest personal goals. 
Once the user is clear on their own purpose and passion, 
Adventure Guide walks the user through the creation of their Life Project: 
the unifying goal the user will devote their life to accomplishing. 
Using this information, 
the user is guided through the process of determining which skills will be required to accomplish their Life Goal, 
and helped to prioritize the order in which those skills are learned.

# Quest-Log
Once a person has chosen their Life Project, 
they become eligible to use the Quest Log: 
the Social Collaboration App that combines all existing project management software into one application. 
This is where the Life Project is strategically broken down into stages and step-by-step goals. 
This is also where likeminded individuals with a diverse set of skills go to collaborate with others on Life Projects. 
For example, 
if a person dedicates their life to solving climate change by developing technologies used to control the weather, 
then they will find on their Recommended Friends' page a bunch of people with the same goal, 
categorized by individual skills and accomplishments. 
Quest Log is on both Desktop and Mobile, 
and by default will hold your Life Project on your lock screen along with your next steps, 
so you never feel lost along the way. 
The Life Project can be changed or modified at any time as the user grows in skill and competency, 
and as the world rapidly changes around them.
